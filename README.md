# Simple-RESTful-API

This was a learning path I took for a deeper understanding of APIs. I am documenting this later when I have actually gained more knowledge of the Subject

## Simple REST API

The api uses the famous REST method of transfer and the state is represented in Json format. It performs basic Update, Delete, and POST. At this time and period I was not able to 
do authentication but I learnt a lot.

## What is it for

It mocks a blog that handles the CRUD function to a MYSQL database. 

## What I used

- Sql queries
- postman
- PHP
